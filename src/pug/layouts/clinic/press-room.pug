The healthcare industry, which is traditionally heavily regulated and thus slow to adopt digital practices, is changing fast. This surge in virtual healthcare has prompted physicians globally to engage with each other and co-share their medical expertise.

According to credible studies, access to adequate and high quality medical research is often a major contributing factor to physician attrition. We built Docquity with that in mind. Our platform is the most convenient way for medical professionals to further their credentials by earning Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and Continuing Medical Education (CME) points from the comfort of their own homes or practice.
